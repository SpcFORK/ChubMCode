# ChubMCode Framework

ChubMCode is a unique framework that utilizes HTML-Lang, a programming language designed to write code in an HTML-like syntax. By translating ChubML into standard HTML, ChubMCode enables developers to create dynamic web content that is then executed by HTMLL (HTML Language).

## Features

- Write code using the familiar tags and structure of HTML
- Seamlessly translate ChubML to HTML for web execution
- Leverage the power of HTMLL to run translated code in the browser

## Getting Started

To get started with ChubMCode, include the ChubML script in your project and start writing your code in `.chub` files. For detailed instructions and documentation, visit the [ChubMCode official website](https://chubml.replit.app/).

## Example

Here's a simple example of ChubML:
```chubcode
html;
  body;
    main;
      s;
        "Hello World!";
      output;
```

This ChubML code will output 'Hello World!' to the web page after being processed by ChubMCode.
